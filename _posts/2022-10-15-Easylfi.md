I solved some web challenges with my idol ginoah. The challenges are awesome!

Description:

Can you read my secret?

The goal is to LFI /flag.txt

This flask app use curl to get a local file

This is server-side challenge.

You access the server:

If you submit `test`, the server redirects to `/hello.html?%7Bname%7D=test:`
