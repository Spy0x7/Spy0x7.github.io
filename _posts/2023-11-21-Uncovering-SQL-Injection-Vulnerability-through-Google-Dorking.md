# Uncovering SQL Injection Vulnerability through Google Dorking

## Introduction

I recently encountered a fascinating security journey sparked by a conversation with my friend, Remonsec, from Bangladesh. Remonsec mentioned the possibility of earning rewards, or "swag," through NCSC_NL. Intrigued, I reached out to my friend, Remonsec, to learn more about the scope of NCSC_NL's program. Remonsec confirmed a wildcard scope, which piqued my interest and prompted me to employ Google dorking techniques to delve deeper into potential vulnerabilities.

## Discovery Process

Utilizing Google dorks, specifically the query `php id= site:.knmi.nl`, I was able to uncover several endpoints associated with KNMI.nl. One such endpoint caught my attention: `https://eca.knmi.nl/utils/stationdetail.php?stationid=168`. To assess its susceptibility to SQL injection, I inserted a single quote (`'`) into the URL, prompting a site response that concealed certain images. This confirmed the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

Taking a manual approach, I endeavored to exploit the vulnerability further. After a few minutes of investigation and trial, I successfully executed an exploit, affirming the presence of the SQL injection flaw. I promptly reported my findings to NCSC_NL, providing detailed information about the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it.

## Response and Resolution

Within a day, NCSC_NL acknowledged the validity of the reported vulnerability. Their swift response and acknowledgment were accompanied by an expression of gratitude, and I received recognition and swag as a token of appreciation for my responsible disclosure.

## Key Takeaways

This experience underscores the effectiveness of employing Google dorking techniques, especially when dealing with wildcard scopes, to unearth potential vulnerabilities within target domains. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of responsible disclosure and collaboration with security organizations to enhance online security.
